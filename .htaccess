# This htaccess file is set up to pass the Authorization header to PHP, because for some reason it is not

# if you have a CGI gateway use this
CGIPassAuth on

# otherwise you can still try this
# RewriteEngine on
# RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
# RewriteRule .* - [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]

# or search for solutions yourself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
